The "c" directory contains the C host language implementation of Apache Lucy.
See the DevGuide for an overview of Lucy's layers:

    http://lucy.apache.org/docs/perl/Lucy/Docs/DevGuide.html

Most of the C files within the "c/src" directory contain stubs for
routines whose interfaces are defined within "trunk/core".  

    core/src/Lucy/Index/Inverter.cfh        # Declares interface.
    core/src/Lucy/Index/Inverter.c          # all except Invert_Doc()
    example-lang/src/Lucy/Index/Inverter.c  # only Invert_Doc() 

Once all the stubs have been implemented correctly, Lucy will theoretically
build and pass its tests.

The build system for the C host language is in development. Get started with:

 % make
 % make test
