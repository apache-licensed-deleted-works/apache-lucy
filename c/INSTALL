Build instructions for the Apache Lucy C library
================================================

Building under UNIX and derivatives or Cygwin
---------------------------------------------

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test

Building under Windows
----------------------

You need MSVC or gcc as C compiler and nmake or mingw32-make as make utility.

When using cmd.exe configure with:

    $ configure.bat

When using the MSYS shell configure with:

    $ ./configure

When building with nmake run:

    $ nmake
    $ nmake test

When building with mingw32-make run:

    $ mingw32-make
    $ mingw32-make test

Configuration
-------------

    ./configure [ options ] [ -- cflags ]

Options include

    --enable-coverage
        Enable code coverage. Create HTML pages with coverage data using
        lcov by running "make coverage".
    --disable-threads
        Disable thread support.
    --clownfish-prefix=path
        Specify an alternative location for Clownfish if it isn't installed
        in a system directory.

To build Lucy with an uninstalled Clownfish, run the following before
configuration:

    . ../devel/bin/setup_clownfish_env.sh clownfish-source-dir
